## I would like to build a tool which can help me to improve my tennis skill by analysing video recording. 

I am developing it during my freetime while improving my tennis skills ^.^



First, I ll try some open source to testout.
Start with these two:
1. DeepCutLab
2. fritz: https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-examples/tree/master/iOS/FritzPoseEstimationDemo
